RedditFunnies is a Mac app that opens the Reddit Funnies page in a Firefox browser, then opens each of the different links on page one in its own tab, saving lots of clicks

To use, download the RedditFunnies.app.zip file and double click on the icon.

Or get py2app from http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html and compile it yourself.
